Daemon Labs is a **hands-on, code-first community and training provider** specialising in applied skill mastery across **Cloud & Platform, Engineering, and Data & AI**.
We cut through theoretical training by offering a unique two-tiered approach that guarantees practical proficiency and direct project impact:

**1. The Community Edition (Free & Public) 🚀**  
  - **Focus:** Hands-on experience with foundational modern technologies (e.g., Docker, Serverless, Data Pipelines).
  - **Purpose:** To share knowledge, grow the technical community, and serve as a free, live proof-of-concept of our high-impact teaching methodology.
  - **Content:** Generic, but laptop-required workshops for all developers and scientists. Our public repositories contain starter code, prerequisites, and instructions for these sessions.

**2. Custom Accelerator Sessions (Tailored Service) 📈**  
  - **Focus:** Accelerated project readiness and team proficiency.
  - **Purpose:** To deliver measurable ROI by closing specific skill gaps directly related to your business goals.
