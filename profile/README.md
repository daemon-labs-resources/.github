Daemon Labs is a **hands-on, code-first community and training provider** specialising in applied skill mastery across **Cloud & Platform, Engineering, and Data & AI**.

- **Content:** Generic, but laptop-required workshops for all developers and scientists. Our public repositories contain starter code, prerequisites, and instructions for these sessions.

**2. The Accelerator Edition (Tailored Service) 📈**

- **Focus:** Accelerated project readiness and team proficiency.
- **Purpose:** To deliver measurable ROI by closing specific skill gaps directly related to your business goals.
