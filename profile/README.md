## Welcome to Daemon Labs!

Daemon Labs is a London-based tech community that specializes in hands-on, laptop-required workshops for engineers, developers, and data scientists. 
Hosted by Daemonâ€™s Centres of Excellence in Cloud & Platform, Engineering, and Data & AI, the group focuses on practical, build-focused sessions led by passionate experts. 
Its core mission is to provide a learning environment where attendees can get their hands dirty with real-world projects, rather than just listening to presentations, empowering them to learn by doing.
